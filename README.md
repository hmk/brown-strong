This repository contains a `BROWN STRONG` design created in a moment of shared difficulty to express solidarity and support for the Brown University community.

The design is intentionally simple and restrained, using official Brown University marks and language to reflect unity rather than commentary. It is shared publicly for transparency and limited community use.

## What This Is

- A single-color design reading **“Brown Strong”**
- Built around the official Brown University seal
- Designed for clarity, reproducibility, and respectful use
- Intended for institutional or community-led production, not commercialization

The design takes visual inspiration from the now-concluded **Brown Together** campaign and updates that approach to reflect how the community comes together *strong* — with shared resolve, care, and support.
